### Test Libraries:  

- analysis/org.eclipse.stem.analysis.automaticexperiment/src/org/eclipse/stem/analysis/automaticexperiment/NelderMeadAlgorithm.java


### Common Practices:

- We have maintained a similar file structure as the original STEM project within our own file structure as specified in Chapter 2 of this report. This does result in extra directories between a root and a target but serves to maintain consistency with the orignal project and thus allow for more flexibility in future updates and further implmentation of this automated testing framework.


### Documentation:

1. navigate to .../TestAutomation/scripts/
2. run the build.sh script
3. run the runAllTest.sh script
4. the results of each test will be written to .../TestAutomation/temp
5. the report document will be in .../TestAutomation/reports
