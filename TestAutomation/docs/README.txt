### Test Libraries:  

- analysis/org.eclipse.stem.analysis.automaticexperiment/src/org/eclipse/stem/analysis/automaticexperiment/NelderMeadAlgorithm.java


### Common Practices:

- We have maintained a similar file structure as the original STEM project within our own file structure as specified in Chapter 2 of this report. This does result in extra directories between a root and a target but serves to maintain consistency with the orignal project and thus allow for more flexibility in future updates and further implmentation of this automated testing framework.


### How to run:

1. Navigate to TestAutomation
2. Run the script with ./scripts/runAllTests.sh
3. The report document will be in .../TestAutomation/reports, but it will automatically be pulled up in Firefox
4. Close the document to stop the process
